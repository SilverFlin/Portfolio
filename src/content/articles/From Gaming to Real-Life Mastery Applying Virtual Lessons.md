Have you ever wondered if the principles of virtual world farming could be applied to the real world?"

I was a heavy Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) player; not that I have played a lot of them, but the few that I played, I spent a lot of hours there. One of the games that I used to enjoy was Dofus, where you have to choose between around 16 classes, each with a different skillset and capabilities. Once you have chosen your class, you'll eventually need in-game currency to develop your character; thus, you'll need to do something to get that. You could go for a harvesting job like farming or fishing, or you could opt for a crafting job like making jewelry. That wasn't the only option to get money; there was an entire economy. You were able to get rich through the market by reselling or helping others pass some dungeons.

It was all nice; fishing and playing with the market were the ways that I lived inside that virtual game. I learned to enjoy the peace of fishing throughout the cities of this game and trying to resell things in the market. That's how I learned the value of perseverance and patience. But I wasn't getting much value, more than the gratification of getting a rare fish or a highly profitable sale, adding virtual money to my character.

So that's the moment when I said:

>  Whoa, why don't I farm things in the real world?

You could get a job and level up your health, strength, and intelligence, couldn't you?

I easily realized that I could, and that means that you too could do that.

## Removing games

If you want to move from games to another more productive field, at some point you will need to remove them.

I tried to do so partially, and at least for me, it doesn't work. It is so difficult to limit yourself to only playing a fraction of what you once played. It could be different for you, but the dopamine hit that you get from playing will keep you hooked for more time than you could establish at some point.

That's why I recommend you completely remove them, at least at the start. Uninstall every game that you have in your hands on your computer or on your phone; hide your console.

If you do not have those things at hand, it will be incredibly easier to make the switch. At the start, it could be difficult, but once you experience different ways of creating more productive distractions, it will be as if you haven't played before.


## Choose your class

A class represents the person that you want to be, whether a musician, an architect, or a software engineer. that'll represent your identity, and you will be able to make choices in the future depending on your class.

Imagine that your class is the Healthy Warrior (you just want to be fit, or perhaps proficient in some sport). If the choice is made, it will be extremely easy to decide whether an extra doughnut is a good idea and how it will impact your stats. It also works for your debuffs. My class of choice is a software engineer, and I do know that this class will spend a lot of time sitting. That's got its own problems, like backaches, so I'll need to be careful with that, stretching each x amount of time and doing exercise.

This could sound familiar to you; it is the third layer of the behavior change in the book Atomic Habits by James Clear.

## Start from the area of Lv. 0-10

Do not try to rush directly to a high-level area; you'll only lose time and end up without motivation, thinking that maybe this isn't for you. Start in the first area and get the fundamentals of whatever you are doing ready before moving on to the next area.

As a software engineer, one of the things that you need to know about is design patterns and architectural design. But if you are starting this career, you can't just go directly to that area; it will be overwhelming. First, you need to know how to program, learn some basic concepts about how computers work, and be at least comfortable with some programming paradigms, e.g., OOP. Then,  you will scale 'til you reach that area of knowledge.

## There's no P2W (Pay to Win)

P2W stands for Pay to Win; it is a term to refer to those players in videogames who, by paying, could reach easily higher areas that a normal player could simply not.

You'll need some money, but that won't drive you directly to the end area; it will help (depending on how wisely you'll spend it), but at the end of the day, there is effort required. You cannot be a professor by just paying, or a top athlete; you need to invest time and effort in it.

## Conclusion

It is just a shift in perspective that will make you see the world as a videogame, and you do not need to be a highly addicted player to take advantage of this switch. Just think: What life principles have you learned from videogames? and apply them; I've provided you with my perspective, and you could take them to change your world.
